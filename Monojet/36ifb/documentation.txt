From 2018 INT:
"since the acceptance of the ETMiss distribution does not change as a function of mÏ‡ at fixed mediator mass in the on-shell regime [...]"
-> Acceptance is constant in vertical lines but not necessarily in horizontal ones.
On-shell point not an issue for this analysis, which is entirely in on-shell region.

Does this mean rescaling to other grids somehow keeps the mediator mass constant? Or equivalent?
